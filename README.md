# PaletteChanger
Color palette changer for CC 1.8 With intuitive (?) UI.
Tested on emulator provided by Wilma456, for full credits see http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/28773-wipcclite-for-craftos-18/, Certain characters will change once full 1.8 charset is supported by that cclite version.

Version 0.5:
RGB Sliders with mouse and keyboard control, instead of just numbers as in previous version.
